# Chapter 1
## Introduction 
- Program languages provide a bridge between machines and people
- They are the mediums of what allows to fully harness the power of modern technology
- Compilers are what allow us to take the abstraction that makes up programming languages and put it into action
## Language Processors:
- Converts a language from one source language to another source language 
  $SourceLanguage \rightarrow Compiler \rightarrow Target Program$
 In certain cases, the target program can call user input and produce an output 
- In other words:
$$SourceLanguage \rightarrow Compiler \rightarrow Target Program \\
input \rightarrow TargetProgram  \rightarrow output$$

## Intrepreters:
- A bit different from compilers, interpreters aim to produce an output based on inputs specified by the users
## Hybrid Compilers:
- Some programming languages such as Java, utilize a combination both interpreters and compilers to produce an output 
- In the case of Java, a compiler compiles Java files into byte code which is execitable by the JVM
- Large programs tend to
